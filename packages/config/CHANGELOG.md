## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 9cbb2eb: Ship each package's migration SQL inside its tarball. `createMigrationsPath()` resolves to `dist/migrations/sql/` at runtime, but tsup bundles JS only, so published packages shipped the migration _loader_ without the `.sql` files it reads — a consumer running the shipped migrations found nothing and had to hand-write schema. The shared migrations build now copies `src/migrations/sql/` into `dist/migrations/sql/`, which `files:["dist"]` carries into the tarball.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 01a2b72: Ship the co-located brain fragment (`brain/{signatures,outcomes}.md`) inside each package tarball (R3). The project-brain compiler reads the installed package's own fragment, so brain knowledge is version-matched by construction — no central registry to skew against. No runtime code change; adds `brain/` to the published files only.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Packaging and DX fixes found by dogfooding a fresh AI-agent install:

  - Every `@fonderie/*/migrations` subpath now actually ships its declared
    `index.d.ts` — the two parallel tsup dts passes raced over `dist/` and the
    migrations declaration was lost on multi-entry packages. Migrations now
    build as a separate sequential pass.
  - The adapters' optional peers are now truly optional: `withWorkspace`,
    `requirePermission`, and `requireFeature` lazy-load
    `@fonderie/workspaces`/`permissions`/`billing` on first request instead of
    statically importing them at module load, with a targeted install error
    when the peer is genuinely missing.
  - `OPERATIONS` and the `Operation` type moved to `@fonderie/core`;
    `@fonderie/permissions` and the adapters re-export them unchanged.
