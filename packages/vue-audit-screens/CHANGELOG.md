# @fonderie/vue-audit-screens

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 86dac61: README links pointed at `github.com/fonderiejs/sdk`, a repository that does not exist (404) — 271 occurrences across 61 packages, including every published README on npm. They now point at `github.com/fonderiejs/fonderie`, matching every package.json `repository` field. Eight READMEs (auth, workspaces, billing, courier, events, audit, webhooks, permissions) also showed `.register(new XModule())` with no arguments, which does not compile: every constructor requires at least the store. The samples now match the generated signatures and typecheck under strict.
- Updated dependencies [86dac61]
  - @fonderie/client@1.0.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f6f54a2: Added context-provider support: configure one FonderieClient at the app root (`<FonderieProvider client={...}>` from `@fonderie/react`, or `app.use(FonderiePlugin, client)` / `provideFonderie(client)` from `@fonderie/vue`) and every hook, composable, and pre-built screen resolves it automatically — `useLogin()` with no argument just works. Passing a client explicitly is still supported everywhere and takes precedence over context, so existing code keeps working unchanged. New packages `@fonderie/react` and `@fonderie/vue` host the shared context.
