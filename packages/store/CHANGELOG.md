# @fonderie/store

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- b134da7: Smoke-test OIDC Trusted Publishing across re-added publishers (no functional change).

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 7f6ca36: Freeze-prep docs: document `IVersionedResource.keyColumns` as an intentional
  fixed 2-tuple. Every versioned resource is addressed by exactly one primary key
  plus one optional null-safe scope; composite 3+-part keys are out of scope by
  design (model the extra dimension inside the primary key or scope). States the
  limit as an owned contract ahead of freezing the surface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- da7e79c: Lift the versioned-resource control-plane primitive into `@fonderie/store` so any
  package can reuse it (no `config` dependency). `versionedWrite` /
  `versionedRollback` / `VersionConflictError` are now exported from store,
  generalized: a resource declares its `(primary, scope)` key columns (null-safe —
  a NULL scope is the base), its revisioned `contentColumns` (one or many), and
  optional main-table `metaColumns`. This serves config's `(key, environment,
value)` and courier's `(type, locale, subject/html/text)` shapes alike.
  `@fonderie/config` re-points onto it; `ConfigConflictError` is now an alias of
  `VersionConflictError` (same exported name, `instanceof` unchanged). Behavior
  preserved — config 36/36 + store tests green, and both shapes proven end-to-end
  against real Postgres (incl. NULL scope + multi-column rollback).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 01a2b72: Ship the co-located brain fragment (`brain/{signatures,outcomes}.md`) inside each package tarball (R3). The project-brain compiler reads the installed package's own fragment, so brain knowledge is version-matched by construction — no central registry to skew against. No runtime code change; adds `brain/` to the published files only.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Packaging and DX fixes found by dogfooding a fresh AI-agent install:

  - Every `@fonderie/*/migrations` subpath now actually ships its declared
    `index.d.ts` — the two parallel tsup dts passes raced over `dist/` and the
    migrations declaration was lost on multi-entry packages. Migrations now
    build as a separate sequential pass.
  - The adapters' optional peers are now truly optional: `withWorkspace`,
    `requirePermission`, and `requireFeature` lazy-load
    `@fonderie/workspaces`/`permissions`/`billing` on first request instead of
    statically importing them at module load, with a targeted install error
    when the peer is genuinely missing.
  - `OPERATIONS` and the `Operation` type moved to `@fonderie/core`;
    `@fonderie/permissions` and the adapters re-export them unchanged.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release of the Fonderie SDK.
