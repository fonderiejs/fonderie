## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 97c7619: Config values without a type picker — and without silent type changes.
  
  - **Admin (React + Vue):** creating an entry no longer asks for a type. One
    field takes text, a number, true/false, or JSON for an object or a list of
    objects; the detected shape is shown as you type, and only genuinely
    ambiguous input ("true", "42") offers "Save as text instead". Anything that
    merely looks like a number — `1.10`, `0123`, `1e3`, a long ID — stays text
    rather than being rewritten. Editing locks the type to what is stored; a
    deliberate "Change type…" is the only way to change it. The environment line
    is now labelled.
  - **config:** every value is stored JSON-encoded, text included. Text used to
    be stored raw and parsed back with a raw fallback, so a text value that
    looked like JSON came back as a different type ("42" → number). Rows written
    the old way still read correctly.
  - **config:** saving a different value kind over an existing key (on/off →
    text, list → object) is refused with `409 CONFIG_TYPE_CHANGE` unless the
    request sends `allowTypeChange: true`. Frontends read flags with a typed
    fallback, so a silent change would read as a different setting — this holds
    for the API, the CLI and the UI alike. `configValueKind()` and
    `ConfigTypeChangeError` are exported.
  - **client:** `inferConfigValue()` and `configValueLabel()`;
    `ISetConfigInput.allowTypeChange`.
  - **cli:** `config set` uses the same inference (it used plain `JSON.parse`,
    which turned "1.10" into 1.1); `--text` and `--allow-type-change` flags.

### Minor Changes

- cc51775: Admin editors that respect the operator's time.
  
  - **Templates:** the preview sits to the right of the editor and stays pinned
    while the form scrolls (it used to wrap below the fold), and it is always
    live — re-rendered 500 ms after the last edit instead of on a Render click.
    Save is disabled with "No changes to save" until the content differs from
    what is stored.
  - **Config & secrets:** the page had no way to create an entry and rendered
    bare headings when empty. It now has an empty state and **New entry** /
    **New secret** buttons; creating refuses an existing key rather than
    overwriting it. Values are edited by type — Text, Number, On/off or JSON —
    instead of raw JSON, and a value that does not parse shows why (it used to
    fail silently). The list shows each entry's type and value.
  - **client:** `castConfigValue`, `configValueType`, `formatConfigValue`,
    `configKeyProblem` and `CONFIG_VALUE_TYPES` — the typed-value rules the
    editors use, shared so feature-flag hooks can use the same casting.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 86dac61: README links pointed at `github.com/fonderiejs/sdk`, a repository that does not exist (404) — 271 occurrences across 61 packages, including every published README on npm. They now point at `github.com/fonderiejs/fonderie`, matching every package.json `repository` field. Eight READMEs (auth, workspaces, billing, courier, events, audit, webhooks, permissions) also showed `.register(new XModule())` with no arguments, which does not compile: every constructor requires at least the store. The samples now match the generated signatures and typecheck under strict.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 615525d: Theme the admin console with the organisation's design tokens.
  
  The console is the surface an operator judges the product by, and it looked
  assembled: seven files carried their own greys, so the same border was `#ddd`
  on one screen, `#e0e0e0` on another and `#eee` on a third, and the token gate
  shipped a different font stack from the pages behind it.
  
  Colour, type, radii and shadow now come from `var(--fonderie-*)`, declared once
  in the served shell. Two consequences beyond the look:
  
  - **Dark mode works.** It never did — the near-white `#ddd`/`#eee` borders and
    the `#f9fafb` code block would have drawn bright lines and panels on a dark
    page. The shell now ships a dark palette under `prefers-color-scheme`, scoped
    `:root:not([data-theme="light"])` so an explicit light choice still wins.
  - **The surface is themeable.** Override any `--fonderie-*` variable on an
    ancestor and the console follows. The prefix is namespaced deliberately: the
    dashboard can be embedded in a consumer's own page, and a bare `--color-text`
    would collide with theirs silently, and only in their app.
  
  Every variable carries a light-palette fallback, because these screens are
  published packages: imported into an app with no Fonderie shell, an unresolved
  `var(--fonderie-text)` yields nothing at all — invisible text, invisible
  borders. With fallbacks an embedded screen renders correctly and is simply not
  themed.
  
  No webfont is fetched. The tokens name Inter first and fall through to the
  system stack, so an admin console does not announce its existence to a third
  party and still works on an air-gapped deploy.
  
  **Theme switcher.** The console offers System / Light / Dark, the same control
  as the organisation UI (markup, icons and CSS copied from its `.theme-switch`).
  Until now "dark" was decided entirely by the OS: there was no rule for forcing
  dark on a light machine and no way to opt out of dark on a dark one. The shell
  gains `:root[data-theme="dark"]` alongside the existing media query, and the
  choice is stored under a namespaced `fonderie.admin.theme` key — the bare
  `theme` key would read and write a host app's own preference on a shared origin.
  
  "System" is the *absence* of `data-theme`, not a snapshot of the OS resolved at
  click time, so system mode keeps following the machine when it flips at sunset
  rather than freezing until reload. An inline boot script applies a stored choice
  before first paint; if it is blocked or storage throws, the console falls back to
  system — the default either way.
  
  **Chrome moved to the corners.** "Forget token" used to sit in a full-width
  strip above the whole console, which spent a band of vertical space on one
  button and pushed the sidebar down from the top edge. The strip is gone: the
  session control docks bottom-left, the theme switcher bottom-right, and the nav
  now reaches the top of the page.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 04a13c1: **Breaking (0.x minor):** the 15 hooks deprecated in the refresh-policy release are removed. Their behavior lives on the list hooks, which self-refresh after writes: `useMembers().removeMember`, `useRoles().updateRole`, `useRolePermissions(roleId).setRolePermissions`, `useWorkspaces().createWorkspace`/`.acceptInvitation`, `usePlans()` admin writes, `useUsage(metric).recordUsage`, `useWebhookDeliveries(endpointId).testEndpoint`, and the config/secret/template save+delete on `useConfigEntries`/`useSecrets`/`useTemplates`. New: `useWebhookEndpoints().testEndpoint(endpointId)` for list-context test-sends (refreshes nothing — a test delivery doesn't change the endpoint list). All pre-built screens are migrated; vue `useTemplates` locale params corrected to `string | null` to match the client.
