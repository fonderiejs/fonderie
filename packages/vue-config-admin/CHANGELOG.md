## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 260e752: Phase 3 of the hook-gap audit: one refresh policy everywhere.
  
  **Client:** every cached GET on the typed sub-clients accepts a trailing `opts?: IReadOptions` (`{ bust?: boolean }`) — pull-to-refresh no longer needs cache pokes from app code. Also fixes a latent bug: `sendVerificationEmail` (a GET send-action) now always bypasses the cache — previously a resend within the cache TTL silently no-oped.
  
  **Hooks (react + vue; react-native via re-export):** every list hook's `refresh` accepts `{ force?: boolean }`, busting its own cache namespace. The Group-C standalone mutation hooks are folded into their list-hook siblings, which self-refresh after each write — `useMembers.removeMember`, `useRoles.updateRole`, `useWorkspaces.createWorkspace`/`acceptInvitation`, `usePlans.createPlan`/`updatePlan`/`deletePlan`, `useUsage.recordUsage`, `useWebhookDeliveries.testEndpoint`, `useConfigEntries`/`useSecrets`/`useTemplates` save+delete. The standalone hooks (`useRemoveMember`, `usePlanAdmin`, `useTestWebhookEndpoint`, …) still work but are `@deprecated` with pointers to their new homes.
