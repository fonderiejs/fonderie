# @fonderie/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b1d053c: Freeze-prep: sync the `IFonderieApp` contract with `FonderieApp` and enforce it.
  The interface modules receive in `install(app)` was missing `boot()` and
  `checkProductionReadiness()` — both are public on the class and part of the app
  lifecycle — so a module typed against `IFonderieApp` couldn't call them. Added
  both to the interface and made `FonderieApp implements IFonderieApp` so the two
  can never silently drift again. Also removed a stale comment referencing a
  `@fonderie-labs/auth` scope that isn't the plan; `ITenant`/`IAuthUser`/
  `IWorkspace` are documented as the real core-owned identity contracts (auth and
  workspaces populate them on the context). Additive — no consumer break.
- dfdcebb: Freeze-prep: drop `_router` from `IFonderieContext`. The field was written onto
  every context but **never read** anywhere — routing dispatches through
  `routerMiddleware(router)`, which closes over the router directly. It only
  leaked router internals into the (soon-to-be-frozen) public context contract and
  forced every context-constructing adapter/test to carry `_router: null as any`
  boilerplate. Removed from the interface, from both core construction sites, and
  from the four adapter/billing test fixtures. No behaviour change.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d4dac8: Add `app.checkProductionReadiness()` — one call that aggregates every module's
  config footguns into a structured report (`{ ok, problems[] }`) you can gate a
  deploy on or expose from a readiness endpoint, instead of relying on scattered
  boot-time warnings. Modules opt in via an optional `IFonderieModule.checkReadiness()`;
  core aggregates without importing them (`ok` is false on any `error`-severity
  problem). Auth reports a weak/placeholder `jwtSecret` (error) and
  `secureCookies: false` (warning); courier reports message types routed to a
  channel with no provider (warning). The existing auto-guards (auth fails closed
  in production, courier warns at boot) are unchanged — this adds the inspectable
  data path alongside them.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e9f785: Production-grade, composable email templates. Templates are now **body
  fragments** injected into a shared branded layout shell (`templates/layout.ts`)
  — a cross-client-hardened responsive frame (max-width card, hybrid inline +
  `<style>` CSS, mobile media query, Outlook VML shim) with a small retunable
  theme token set (`EMAIL_THEME`). One shell, many bodies: the DB and FS resolvers
  both compose it, so every transactional email renders the same frame for free.

  Seeds now ship the templates auth and workspaces actually send —
  `email-verification`, `password-reset`, `workspace-invitation`, `email-changed`
  (previously only `email-verification` was seeded; the rest fell through to a raw
  JSON debug fallback). Founders can override the whole shell by storing a
  `_layout` template (DB row or `_layout.html` file); a template that is already a
  full HTML document is passed through untouched (never double-wrapped).

  Localization is now wired end-to-end. `IAuthUser` carries the user's `locale`
  (sourced from the DB row via the session middleware), and every auth/workspaces
  notification emit now stamps `locale` on the courier message so per-locale
  templates are actually selected. The resolver's locale lookup was made
  region-safe: it serves the **exact** locale or the neutral `NULL` default and
  **never a sibling region** (`en-CA` will not fall back to `en-US`) — the SQL now
  uses `locale IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $2` ordering plus a `(locale = $2 OR locale IS
NULL)` filter, so legal/jurisdictional copy can't bleed across regions.
  Workspace invitations intentionally omit `locale` (the invitee's language is
  unknown at invite time) and fall to the neutral default.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bbd3e9a: `FonderieApp.listen()` now returns the underlying `http.Server` (previously `void`), so you can await `listening`, close it for graceful shutdown, or hand it to a supertest-style harness. Adds a `quiet` option to suppress the startup banner (tests / quiet deploys). Backward compatible — existing `app.listen(port)` calls are unaffected. This also unblocks a regression test proving the built-in server forwards multiple `Set-Cookie` headers (the cookie fix from #55/#56).
- f18ac65: Add `onResponse` — an opt-in config hook to adapt Fonderie's response contract. It transforms every JSON response body at the single egress point (adapter-agnostic; status, headers, and cookies preserved), so an app can serve its own shape — e.g. flatten Fonderie's `{ reason, explanation, result: { tokens, user } }` into a frontend's expected `{ user, accessToken, refreshToken }` — without editing any handler. Unset = unchanged behaviour. Surfaced by the client-app rewrite (Phase 1): the response envelope was the single biggest contract divergence, and this closes it with one config option instead of a per-app adapter, moving existing-frontend adoption toward drop-in.

### Patch Changes

- e4d9bb2: Complete the auth-cookie fix across every response egress. The same `Set-Cookie` mangling fixed in `@fonderie/adapter-express` also existed in `@fonderie/adapter-koa` and in `@fonderie/core`'s built-in `app.listen()` HTTP server: forwarding headers with `forEach` + `set()`/`setHeader()` overwrites all but the last `Set-Cookie`, so cookie-based auth silently broke there too. Both now forward the full list via `getSetCookie()`. `@fonderie/adapter-hono` was already correct (it returns the Web `Response` natively). Found by auditing sibling packages after the express fix.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 01a2b72: Ship the co-located brain fragment (`brain/{signatures,outcomes}.md`) inside each package tarball (R3). The project-brain compiler reads the installed package's own fragment, so brain knowledge is version-matched by construction — no central registry to skew against. No runtime code change; adds `brain/` to the published files only.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 4b2074d: Refactor the private/loopback IP check in `resolveClientIp`'s proxy-config
  detection into named constants (`LOOPBACK_IPS`, `PRIVATE_IP_PREFIXES`,
  `CGNAT_OR_RFC1918_172`) instead of an inline `||` chain — same behavior,
  clearer intent, and now covered by tests (all RFC1918/link-local/ULA ranges
  warn; public IPs don't).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 237777a: New package **@fonderie/rate-limit** and default brute-force protection in auth.

  - `@fonderie/rate-limit`: an atomic token-bucket limiter with three
    interchangeable stores — `MemoryStore` (single instance), `StoreAdapterStore`
    (distributed over Postgres via one `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` upsert), and
    `RedisStore` (one Lua `eval`, no Redis dependency — structural client). Emits
    IETF `RateLimit-Limit`/`-Remaining`/`-Reset` + `Retry-After`. Ships a
    `migrations/` subpath for the Postgres backend.
  - `@fonderie/auth` now rate-limits login, registration, password reset, and
    MFA verification **by default**, backed by the module's own store adapter —
    distributed-correct across instances with zero configuration. Login uses
    dual limits (per-IP and per-account). Tune via the new `rateLimit` config
    field, inject a `RedisStore` for scale, or set `rateLimit: false`.
  - `@fonderie/core` + adapters: `resolveClientIp()` populates
    `ctx.meta.clientIp` with explicit proxy trust (`TRUST_PROXY`), which the
    limiter's `byIp()` keying consumes.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- One request-validation layer across every endpoint-exposing package:

  - `validate(schema)` middleware in `@fonderie/core/middlewares` (structural
    `safeParse` interface — core stays dependency-free)
  - zod request schemas on all 43 body-taking routes across auth, workspaces,
    billing, customers, and webhooks; invalid input returns 422
    `INVALID_PARAMETER` with a field path before the controller runs; parsed
    bodies are trimmed and stripped of unknown keys
  - schemas exported per package (`schemas.*`) so docs generators and typed
    clients read the same contract the runtime enforces
  - provider-shaped webhooks (`/billing/webhook`, `/courier/delivery/*`) are
    deliberately exempt — gated by signature verification instead

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Packaging and DX fixes found by dogfooding a fresh AI-agent install:

  - Every `@fonderie/*/migrations` subpath now actually ships its declared
    `index.d.ts` — the two parallel tsup dts passes raced over `dist/` and the
    migrations declaration was lost on multi-entry packages. Migrations now
    build as a separate sequential pass.
  - The adapters' optional peers are now truly optional: `withWorkspace`,
    `requirePermission`, and `requireFeature` lazy-load
    `@fonderie/workspaces`/`permissions`/`billing` on first request instead of
    statically importing them at module load, with a targeted install error
    when the peer is genuinely missing.
  - `OPERATIONS` and the `Operation` type moved to `@fonderie/core`;
    `@fonderie/permissions` and the adapters re-export them unchanged.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release of the Fonderie SDK.
