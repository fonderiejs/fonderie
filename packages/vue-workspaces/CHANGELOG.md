# @fonderie/vue-workspaces

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 57df01c: The last two audit read gaps: `useWorkspace(workspaceId)` and `useRole(roleId)` — read hooks with `refresh({force})` for the explicit-id lookups (`getWorkspace`/`getRole`) that previously had no hook. Current-workspace mutations stay in `useWorkspaceProfile` (they act on the client's workspace scope, not an explicit id). Vue versions take `MaybeRefOrGetter` params and refetch on change. The hook-coverage CI gate's allow-list entries for both methods are removed — they're now enforced as covered.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ec38b6: Vue composables now match the React hooks' reactive contract: data parameters accept MaybeRefOrGetter and refetch on change; initial fetches run in onMounted (SSR-safe); every composable exports its IUse*Return interface.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 260e752: Phase 3 of the hook-gap audit: one refresh policy everywhere.
  
  **Client:** every cached GET on the typed sub-clients accepts a trailing `opts?: IReadOptions` (`{ bust?: boolean }`) — pull-to-refresh no longer needs cache pokes from app code. Also fixes a latent bug: `sendVerificationEmail` (a GET send-action) now always bypasses the cache — previously a resend within the cache TTL silently no-oped.
  
  **Hooks (react + vue; react-native via re-export):** every list hook's `refresh` accepts `{ force?: boolean }`, busting its own cache namespace. The Group-C standalone mutation hooks are folded into their list-hook siblings, which self-refresh after each write — `useMembers.removeMember`, `useRoles.updateRole`, `useWorkspaces.createWorkspace`/`acceptInvitation`, `usePlans.createPlan`/`updatePlan`/`deletePlan`, `useUsage.recordUsage`, `useWebhookDeliveries.testEndpoint`, `useConfigEntries`/`useSecrets`/`useTemplates` save+delete. The standalone hooks (`useRemoveMember`, `usePlanAdmin`, `useTestWebhookEndpoint`, …) still work but are `@deprecated` with pointers to their new homes.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2711d2f: Phase 2 of the hook-gap audit: full auth-account and MFA-enrollment coverage, and the role-permissions read/write pair.
  
  **New auth hooks (react / react-native / vue):**
  - `useMfaSetup` — the complete MFA enrollment lifecycle: `setup()` (secret + otpauth URI), `verify(code)` which **persists the rotated tokens** the server issues on enrollment (previously nothing consumed them and the session went stale), `disable(code)`, and `regenerateBackupCodes(code)`.
  - `useProfile` — loads the profile and owns `updateProfile` / `updatePreferences` / `updateEmail` / `updatePhone`, self-refreshing.
  - `useChangePassword`, `useAccountData` (`exportData` + `deleteUser` with logout-equivalent teardown).
  - `useVerifyEmail` gains `resend()` / `resent` — both halves of the verification lifecycle in one hook.
  
  **New workspaces hook (react / react-native / vue):** `useRolePermissions(roleId)` — the read half that `useSetRolePermissions` never had, plus a self-refreshing write, so permission editors can pre-populate. `useSetRolePermissions` remains for compatibility.
  
  Client input/result types used by the new hooks are re-exported from each package index.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f6f54a2: Added context-provider support: configure one FonderieClient at the app root (`<FonderieProvider client={...}>` from `@fonderie/react`, or `app.use(FonderiePlugin, client)` / `provideFonderie(client)` from `@fonderie/vue`) and every hook, composable, and pre-built screen resolves it automatically — `useLogin()` with no argument just works. Passing a client explicitly is still supported everywhere and takes precedence over context, so existing code keeps working unchanged. New packages `@fonderie/react` and `@fonderie/vue` host the shared context.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f6f54a2]
  - @fonderie/vue@0.2.0
